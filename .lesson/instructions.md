# Task - Predict and Run

Before doing anything, notice the three tabs above these instructions. You will be using the Console and Instructions tab. The Shell tab can be ignored.

The Console tab is where the output of your programs goes. When the program wants to send a message to the user (you), that is where it appears.

Click the big green run button.

Most of this program is comments. Comments are ignored by Python, and are a way for people to put notes in their code.

Only the line
```
print("Hello World!")
```
Is an instruction to Python to do something.

Add comments to the code predicting what will happen if we removed the comments from the other instructions in this code (we call that _uncommenting_.  **You are not being graded on the accuracy of your predictions!!** Making a prediction, and then testing it is a great way to learn.

Don't forget to put a # in front of each of your predictions so the computer doesn't think you are talking to it!

Once you have made your predictions, remove the comments from the lines with the word print to see if you were right.

## Indentation Errors
Python is very, very fussy about indentation. All of your instructions must be indented exactly the same amount (in this case, with no indentation at all).
Put a single space in front of one of the print statements. Try to run. You will see an indentation error message. Remove the space again.

Now you know how to fix those when they show up - make sure everything is lined up properly.


## Help! My Code Doesn't Work!

Make sure that you check for the following things:

- all of your code is indented by the same number of spaces.
- print does not have a capital letter
- The string text is surrounded with quotation marks `" "`
- The string (including quotation marks) is surrounded by parenthesis `()`.
